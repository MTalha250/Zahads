    content: `### How do I start the visa process?
Once your establishment card is issued you will need to contact your Visa Consultant. They will guide you through the process and collect the necessary documents.

- The original corporate documents that you have received from Zahads
- CV of Shareholders and Directors
- A business summary
- Additional documents may also be requested

Opening a UAE bank account is free of charge if you do it on your own. However, each bank has its own requirements when it comes to maintaining a minimum monthly balance. We can also help you set up your bank account.

### How can I collect my company documents?
Once your licence is issued, you will receive an email from the Zahads team. You may then schedule a meeting with our Client Service Specialist and collect your documents at a convenient time.

### What is the process and procedure for renewing my trade license?
Your relationship manager will send you notifications for renewal 3 months before it is due. When it is convenient for you contact them and they will handle the procedure for you.

Your Visa Specialist will then guide you through the process.

    content: `### Can my local partner take control of my business?
Yes, but only if you are not structured correctly. At Zahads we offer comprehensive advice on company structuring and can implement a few mechanisms to ensure you always remain in control of your business.

### What happens if my local partner passes away?
If your local partner is a natural person, then an heir will inherit the 51% share in your business. It is then up to that person if he or she wishes to continue in the same manner as nominee shareholder or if they wish to negotiate new terms or be more involved in the business. At Zahads we offer a corporate nominee shareholder solution that can protect you in the event of the passing of a local partner.

### Can foreigners now own Mainland companies 100%?
Yes, in some cases this is possible. If interested, please contact Zahads and we will see if we can do this for you.

### What if I want to change my local partner?
Zahads offers a market leading 30-day notice period without penalty if you wish for us to transfer the shares to a new partner while under our sponsorship. However, if you have a natural person as your local partner it is your responsibility to negotiate exit terms at the time of exit.

### Can my UAE mainland company buy property?
Yes, your mainland company can own both residential and commercial property in the UAE.

### If I have a 51% local partner, can I still fully control my business?

Secretaries can help with this. However, offices can get cluttered and unless you have some kind of sorting system, mail can still take a while to find.

While some of these challenges can be resolved through contract negotiations or with the help of friends and family, others are best handled by a team of legal professionals. When it comes to retaining a legal team in Dubai, there are a few key benefits you can expect. Increased Compliance: The legal landscape in Dubai is constantly changing. With a retained legal team, you always have someone monitoring local legislation. They can resolve any compliance issues that may arise. This can help your company avoid fines, penalties, or even the loss of its business license. Reduced Risks: One of the biggest concerns for companies operating in Dubai is avoiding risk. Businesses that do not have a retained legal team may be at risk of violating local laws and regulations. This can lead to costly lawsuits or even the loss of business rights in the United Arab Emirates. Diligence: A retained legal team will conduct due diligence on your behalf before you begin any new project or venture with another company in Dubai. This includes conducting a thorough background check on the other party and reviewing contracts for any red flags. Legal Advice: It’s hard to run a business without legal advice from time to time, but finding competent lawyers in Dubai can be difficult. When you retain a team of legal professionals, they will ensure that all your questions are answered promptly. Immediate Legal Representation: It doesn’t happen often but sometimes people need immediate legal representation. This is especially true for companies that operate in Dubai but are headquartered elsewhere around the world. A retained team of lawyers can ensure that your company’s interests are protected at all times, even when you’re not physically present. The above benefits will help protect your business from unnecessary risks and liabilities while also providing peace of mind.",

Now, you might be thinking, do startups need to outsource? Well, outsourced receptionist services could be the solution to limiting startup costs and improving customer experience. As everyone knows, starting a business comes with many challenges, so instead of hiring employees to do reception work, why not outsource the job to save you time and money?

Compared to traditional receptionists you sit at a desk all day taking calls and answering messages, virtual receptionists do the same tasks but from the comfort of their own homes or offices. So, what do virtual receptionists do? Virtual receptionists normally direct callers, provide information and deal with general business enquiries. They act in the same way as a traditional receptionist so your clients will never tell the difference. Even though they do the same job, you might be wondering how virtual receptionists work. For example, you might be asking the question, how can someone answer your company calls if they’re not in the same office? Or, how can you communicate with your virtual receptionist?",

Some of these sectors include hospitality, manufacturing and renewable energy. It’s worth noting that each jurisdiction within the UAE has its own rules relating to foreign-owned businesses. As such, if you decide to establish a business in one of the aforementioned sectors in a particular region, it is not guaranteed that these freedoms will apply to you. There are 60 different jurisdictions, just to complicate things! If your business does not fall into one of these designated sectors or zones, there is a range of other conditions you must meet to start a business. These conditions are not unachievable.

If you’re eligible for a visa on arrival, you should take advantage of it. These visas will vary in length depending on the country in which your passport was issued. Eligible citizens must present a passport with no less than six months until expiry. If your passport has less than six months of validity, you must obtain a new passport before travelling to the UAE. If you are a passport holder of one of the following countries, you are eligible for a 30-day visa: Andorra, Australia, Brunei, Canada, China, Hong Kong, Japan, Kazakhstan, Macau, Malaysia, Mauritius, Monaco, New Zealand, The Republic of Ireland, San Marino, Singapore, Ukraine, The United Kingdom and Northern Ireland, The United States of America, Vatican City. Passport holders from the above countries can access a UAE visa on arrival free of charge. It’s also worth noting that this is a single-entry visa. Alternatively, if you are a passport holder of one of the following countries, you can access a 90-day, multiple-entry visa, free of charge: Argentina, Austria, The Bahamas, Barbados, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Croatia, Cyprus, The Czech Republic, Denmark, El Salvador, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Honduras, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Kiribati, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, The Maldives, Malta, Montenegro, Nauru, The Netherlands, Norway, Paraguay, Peru, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russian Federation, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, San Marino, Serbia, Seychelles, Slovakia, Slovenia, Solomon Islands, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Uruguay. If you’re a Mexican citizen, you can access a 180-day, multiple-entry visa on arrival. To be eligible, you must present plane tickets, health insurance and a hotel reservation. As mentioned above, you must also have at least six months of validity left on your passport to apply. The rules are slightly different for Indian passport holders. If that’s you, you can only access a 14-day visa on arrival if you can present one of the following: A USA-issued visit visa valid for at least six months; A USA-issued green card valid for at least six months; or Evidence of holding a UK or EU residence. This visa will set you back AED 120, which equates to about USD 33.

To apply for a prearranged visa, you will need: A colour copy of your passport; A colour photograph of yourself; An application form; A copy of your plane ticket. A 48-hour and 96-hour non-extendable visa will set you back USD 10 and 30 respectively. Alternatively a single entry, short-term tourist visa will cost USD 90. This option is extendable.

Otherwise, if you’re looking to stay in the UAE for an extended period of time, you could apply for a long-term tourist visa.

Prior to the introduction of this visa program, you would have needed to be sponsored by an Emirati national or obtain work in the UAE to spend such an extended time in the country. This visa removes those barriers, opening up the UAE to a much larger population of foreign workers. Unfortunately, this visa program does not allow you to establish a business in the UAE. As such, if your goal is to establish a business in the country, the one-year remote working visa may not be for you. However, if you want an extended taste of life in the UAE prior to making a decision about whether to locate your business there, this visa could be a good option. Spending a year building business relationships while working your day job remotely may not be such a bad idea. In fact, it could be a great start to your new life as an entrepreneur in the UAE. The remote-working visa application will set you back USD 287. There are other costs involved, including UAE health insurance and ID fees. These costs may vary. In total, however, you are likely to spend upwards of USD 600. To apply for this visa, you’ll need a passport with no less than six months validity and UAE health insurance. Employees will also need to present the following: Proof of employment; A work contract no shorter than a year; Proof of a salary no less than USD 5,000/month; Three months bank statements. Business owners will also need to present the following: Proof of business ownership of no less than one year; An average monthly income of no less than USD 5000/month; Three months bank statements.",

These e-gates allow you to register your identity and present your passport and documentation. The e-gate will also scan your retina. While unlikely, you may be selected for random screening. If this occurs, you’ll need to present evidence of your visa. A charge of AED 30 may apply if you do not have a hard copy of your visa confirmation number.",

You don’t have to imagine. That’s what’s on offer in the United Arab Emirates. The only catch is that to stay in the country long-term you’ll need a UAE Golden Visa.\n\nWhat’s a Golden Visa in the UAE?\nWe’ve prepared this guide to answer all your questions about the United Arab Emirate’s prestigious Golden Visa.

          "Unlike many other international Visa programs, the United Arab Emirates’ unique Golden Visa program allows eligible individuals permanent residence with a 10 year visa. However, it also comes with a range of attractive privileges that most typical residence visa programs would not offer.\n\nLaunched in 2019, the famous Golden Visa program functioned as a bid to attract and retain foreign talent with permanent residence in a tax-friendly environment. The program also aimed to foster business development to boost the UAE’s economy.\n\nIt worked.\n\nBy late 2021, 44,000 Dubai residents had secured long-term residency through the Golden Visa. The program may also form part of the reason the UAE fared so well through the pandemic. The program has certainly bolstered the UAE’s global standing as an attractive place to live, work and kickstart new businesses.\n\nThe Golden Visa program specifically aims to attract budding entrepreneurs, investors and talented individuals in specific fields. Medical staff, engineers, researchers and even high-achieving university students can be eligible for the program.\n\nGolden Visa Residency is applicable for ten years. In some situations, the visas can also be renewed automatically – a handy feature for those who struggle with the endless monotony of bureaucracy. Features like this prove that the UAE government wants to make the visa application process simple. Anyone who’s ever applied for a foreign visa will know how painful these processes can sometimes be.",

The UAE government has worked hard to ensure the program has enough perks to attract the best of the best from around the globe. Although, the year-round sunshine, ultra-modern infrastructure and stunning beaches couldn’t hurt.\n\n1) You Don’t Need a Local Sponsor\nGolden Visa holders do not need to obtain a local sponsor to live, study and work in the UAE.\n\nTo those unfamiliar with common residency processes around the world, this may not sound like a big deal. However, those who are familiar will know how time-consuming and complex obtaining a local sponsor can be. This complexity is often compounded if you aren’t employed by a local company or you don’t know any nationals from the country in which you are trying to secure a residence visa.\n\nNot needing a national sponsor to obtain a Golden Visa takes a large degree of complexity out of applying for residency in the UAE. All the more reason to apply!\n\n2) You Can Own 100% of Your Business\nAnother major benefit of the Golden Visa is that visa holders can own 100% of a business operating out of the UAE.\n\nThis is a big deal.\n\nBefore the introduction of the Golden Visa program, foreigners seeking to start a business in the UAE needed to partner with an Emirati national, who will own a percentage of the company. There were exceptions for certain industries located in specific zones.\n\nThe Golden Visa removes these logistical barriers for eligible foreign entrepreneurs, business owners and investors.\n\n3) You Can Add Other People to Your Visa\nIf you secure a visa through the UAE’s Golden Visa program, you do not need to go through all the hassle of obtaining visas for your family members or key businesses associates. If you obtain a Golden Visa, you can add your family members to it. You can also add business partners or associates to the visa, subject to some specific conditions.\n\nIf you have a partner or kids travelling with you to the UAE, this particular feature of the Golden Visa program could save you a lot of paperwork. It could also prevent your family from being separated.\n\n4) You Can Travel Freely to and from the UAE\nGold Visa holders can travel to and from the UAE as many times as they want. In this regard, having a Golden Visa is like being a UAE citizen. Visit friends and family back home or schedule as many overseas business meetings as you like. There are no limits – you’re free to go!\n\nAdditional benefits for Golden Visa Holders in different Emirates\nGolden Visa programs in different Emirates offer a variety of benefits to you and your family members across various sectors. When looking to apply for citizenship its important to consider all visa options.",

This area is critical for businesses operating in Dubai, and it’s important to have an experienced professional who can help you stay compliant with the laws and regulations.

There are several different types of businesses that can be set up in Dubai, and the accounting and tax requirements will vary depending on the type. In any case, filing your taxes and keeping your books in order is a complex process, and it’s important to have an expert on your side.

        description:
          "A lot of people are curious about the differences in taxes between Dubai and other countries, like the US. In the UAE there is no personal income tax, but businesses must pay a corporate tax rate of 24%. This is significantly lower than the corporate tax rates in other countries, such as the US (35%) but slightly higher than the UK (21%). However, there are other taxes that businesses must pay in Dubai, such as the Zakat tax which is a religious tithe that all Muslims must pay. The Zakat tax is usually around two and a half percent of a company’s annual profits. Various other taxes may apply, depending on the business type and location. It’s important to consult with a pro services company that can guide you on making the most of the tax infrastructure in Dubai. For example, the Dubai Free Zone offers many tax exemptions for businesses located there. For example: 100% exemption from corporate tax for the first five years, 50% exemption from corporate tax for the next five years, 100% exemption from Zakat tax, No import duties on capital goods and raw materials. If that sounds intriguing to you, it probably should! There are a host of benefits to setting up a business at a free zone in Dubai. We have a lot of experience helping clients to set up businesses in Dubai, and we can help you to take advantage of all the tax exemptions available.",

          "Before we dive into how to open a bank account in the United Arab Emirates, let’s take a minute to talk about the banking sector. The UAE has a banking system that’s regulated by a central bank. Apart from the central bank, there is a total of roughly 50 international and local banks scattered throughout the country. The banking system is considered to be fairly stable thanks to the banks’ liquidity buffers and resilient capital levels. Most banks in the UAE are funded by deposits. Their strong capital levels provide a large buffer that absorbs any losses. The UAE has four different types of banks. These types of banks include: Commercial banks, Investment banks, Industrial banks, Islamic banks. Islamic banks are a type of bank that has grown in popularity. In recent years, UAE banks have worked to expand their banking services to consumers using Islamic financial requirements. This is important for the many Islamic citizens living in the country. At the moment, there are 23 Islamic bank windows and 8 full-fledged Islamic banks in the nation. These institutions make up nearly 20% of the UAE’s banking sector. Aside from Islamic banks in the nation, the UAE banks also cater to foreigners and international consumers. They have adopted several international regulations and offer all their banking services in both Arabic and English. A few international regulations that UAE banks comply with include: International Accounting Standard, International Financial Reporting Standards, Capital Adequacy Regulations from the Basel III Regulations.",

        title: "Types of Bank Accounts in the UAE",
        description:
          "The next thing to know about before looking into bank account opening in the UAE is what types of bank accounts you can open. There are several different types of bank accounts, which cater to both non-residents and residents of the UAE. Current Accounts. An Emirates Islamic Current Account is a transaction account, which comes with a checking option for the accountholder. An Emirates Islamic Current Account comes with Debit card facilities, check-book, along with many other banking benefits. A current account is ideal for transfers and transactions made on a daily basis. Your current account will come with a check-book, which is great for issuing rent checks to your landlord. Banks in the United Arab Emirates usually allow you to open two types of current accounts. One type comes with salary transfers while the other does not. If you have a job in the UAE, you can open an account at your employer’s bank to get your salary faster. If you use a different bank from your employer, it could take up to a few days for your salary to arrive. You can open an Emirates Islamic Current Account for several major currencies, including USD*, GBP, AED, Euro, Yen, Saudi Riyal, Kuwaiti Dinar, Canadian Dollar, Qatari Riyal, Bahraini Dinar and Omani Riyal. However if you open your Current Account in a different currency it will not offer debit card and cheque book facility options. When opening a Current Account the minimum balance requirement must maintain at least AED 3,000 in the account. However when your salary is transferred to the Current Account, the minimum balance requirement is waived. Savings Accounts. Many people in the UAE open a savings account so that they can get the most out of their money. Savings accounts offer higher interest rates than checking accounts do, but provide limited access to funds. They also can cause penalties for withdrawals. Savings accounts usually operate on either a variable or fixed interest rate. Within your savings account you can choose which currency you’d like to denominate your funds in. Savings accounts can also be used as salary accounts. However, savings accounts do not usually come with a check-book, which can make them a little inconvenient for this type of use. When opening a savings account is important to choose the right bank. The interest rate, minimum deposit and fees for your savings account will differ from bank to bank. While these amounts may be minor they can add up over an extended period of time, costing you money. Investment Accounts. Another type of service you can take advantage of when opening a bank account in the UAE is an investment account. In the UAE, you can sign an investment agreement with any bank, which allows you to open an investment account. The investment period for these usually ranges from 12 months to 10 years, but they can be longer, too. The investment agreement gives you a minimum assured ROI of 3-7% annually. Just note that investment accounts come with minimum balances. The minimum required balance will vary depending on which bank you choose to partner with. Offshore Accounts. The UAE is a haven for expats, which is why the nation offers offshore banks from jurisdictions the world over. This is especially true in Dubai, where many expats choose to live and work. In the United Arab Emirates, anyone who holds a valid residence visa is eligible to open an offshore account and use it to import and export their funds. It’s considered to be a secure, stable, and reliable way of moving money and usually involves lower taxes than other banking options. Offshore banking encompasses many different services in the United Arab Emirates. A few of these services include: Asset protection, Wealth management, Portfolio management, Private bank accounts, Company formation, Inheritance planning.",

          "With all this information, you’re ready to go ahead and open a bank account in UAE. Doing so is very quick and efficient, and typically takes anywhere from a couple of days to a couple of weeks. To open either a current account or a savings account, UAE residents will need to provide the following documentation: Your original passport as well as a copy, A copy of your UAE resident visa, A salary certificate, Your Emirates ID card or a copy of your registration form if you haven’t yet received it. If you’re a non-resident, you’ll only be able to open a savings account. Even though you won’t get a checkbook, you’ll still receive a debit card that you can use to withdraw money. To open a savings account as a non-resident, many banks run background checks. Then, they request the following documents: A recent utility bill, A reference letter from your home bank, The six most recent monthly bank statements from your home bank, Information proving consistent funding sources. These documents are needed to make sure that you really do have the means to maintain a bank account in the UAE. A Non-resident savings account can take a little longer to open thanks to the extra documentation.",

        title: "Opening an Account on a Mobile Device",
        description:
          "Another important thing to note about opening a bank in the UAE is mobile banking. In a society that’s focused on the latest technology, it’s no surprise that there are two banks that make it possible for you to open an account in their mobile phone banking app. Whilst most banks will have a mobile banking function to help you transfer money and check your balance, they may not allow you to apply for new accounts through their mobile banking app. Some of the banks that allow mobile account creation are Liv, which is backed by Emirates NBD; Neo, which is powered by Mashreq; and YAP, the UAE’s first independent digital banking platform. To open a bank account with one of these banks, you’ll need to start by downloading the application. Then, scan your Emirates ID into the system. From there, you’ll be guided through an account opening screen similar to those found online. Once the account is open, you’ll need to add some funds to get the account started. As soon as your account has funds in it, you’re ready to go! In a day or two, a local delivery crew will contact you to let you know when they’ll deliver your new debit card. The debit cards from these banks work internationally and at several different ATMs. Plus, your bank comes with a Swift code and IBAN account number so that you can easily make transfers using your new account.",

        title: "Corporate Accounts",
        description:
          "If you’re planning to use your bank account to do business in the UAE, you’ll need to open a corporate bank account. The reason why you have to open a corporate account is that UAE law prohibits you from doing business with a personal account. Generally speaking, corporate accounts should be current accounts. The reason for this is so that they can process a large volume of transactions. Opening a current corporate account in the UAE usually takes between two and four weeks. When you go to open a corporate bank account, it’s important to note that you’ll need a few additional documents to do so. The exact documents may vary depending on your chosen bank and your type of company, but they usually include: Your company trade license, A certificate of your company’s registration, Share certificates, The company’s articles of association and memorandum, A letter from the board giving a company officer the power to open a corporate account, Visas and passports from all shareholders. With these documents in hand, you’ll be all set to open a bank account.",

          "As an expat, it can be nerve-wracking to open a bank account in the UAE. You might be worried that you won’t be able to get all the services you need because you’re a foreigner. The good news is that roughly 85% of the UAE’s population are expats, meaning that banks are more than used to dealing with your needs. They’ll have the resources needed to make sure that you get the assistance you require in opening your account. Either way, there are a few questions you can ask to help you make sure that you’re opening a bank account with a good financial institution. Some key questions to ask include: Do you have a required minimum balance and if so, what is it? What fees and penalties are associated with the account? Do you have requirements for salary transfers? What is the monthly withdrawal limit? What ATM cards, debit cards, and new checkbook fees should I be aware of? Do you offer international transfer services and if so, where to and how long do they take? How many ATM locations do you have and where are they? What happens if my account has an outstanding loan and I lose my job? Getting the answers to these questions will help you figure out whether or not this bank can meet your needs. In addition to these questions, you should check to see if your employer banks with your chosen financial institution. This can make it easier for you to get access to your salary. You can also check out what other colleagues, friends and reviewers have to say about the bank. This will give you a good idea of what it’s like to bank with this company.",

        description:
          "The UAE has its own set of GAAP accounting principles. The International Federation of Accountants (IFAC) is in charge of maintaining these standards. The GAAP principles apply to all the UAE government entities and state-owned companies. The accounting standards of the UAE are based on the following principles: Income is recognised when it is realised or realisable. Expenses are recognised when they are incurred. Revenue is recognised when it is earned. You should measure assets and liabilities at fair value, except for financial instruments and leases. These are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rates. Running your own business in Dubai is a fun challenge. However, it can also be a struggle when it comes to accounting and bookkeeping. Here are five policies you need to follow: Record Keeping Policy. Under the UAE Federal Law, you should keep your financial records and statements. You must ensure those records are intact for at least five years. The Ministry of Finance recommends keeping records for ten years to prove tax compliance. Cash Receipts. Transactions of up to AED 1,000 need evidence supported by a receipt. Receipts must be in the name of the business. They must include the date of issue, signature of the person issuing the receipt, and recipient. You must also indicate the amount and nature of the transaction. The details are essential for proof of transactions. They also improve accounting accuracy. Bank Transactions. All bank transactions need the support of a bank statement. The statement must include the date of the transaction and the name and address of the business receiving the funds. You also need to include the amount and nature of the transaction. Companies can keep an electronic record of the statements. Keeping these records helps in accurately preparing an annual budget and profit and loss accounts. VAT Returns. Businesses operating in UAE must comply with Value Added Tax (VAT) regime, effected on January 1st 2018. The new tax applies to all companies in UAE, whether your services are local or outside UAE. Businesses are required to register for VAT if they meet the eligibility criteria. Taxes in Dubai can be a complex matter. As such, your business should adopt a VAT Return Policy that makes sense. It should be in line with industry best practices. Other Supporting Documents. Other supporting documents include invoices, credit notes and contracts. Also, include bank statements for businesses that are not registered for VAT. The above documents should be in their original form. Copies of the documents are not acceptable.",

          "Many small businesses attempt to do their books. This is common when a firm doesn’t want to spend money on accounting firms. Business owners also think they can keep things more “in-house.” However, this often leads to a lot of stress and time wasted. Accounting is complex and a full-time job in itself. If you are running a business, you likely already have enough on your plate. Instead of doing everything by yourself, consider the following options: Hiring Accounting Staff. This involves getting an in-house permanent accounting employee. Depending on your company’s size, you can hire one or a team of accountants. The hiring process involves posting the job offer on your website or job websites. You interview several candidates until you find the perfect fit. Some of the qualifications you should look for include experience in reconciliation, monitoring/recording accounts payables and accounts receivables transactions, basic bookkeeping and financial reporting. If you are lucky to find a reliable accounting staff member, they can handle all accounting operations. Alternatively, you can use outsourced accounting services in the UAE. Outsourcing Accounting Services. Accounting outsourcing is the transfer of accounting functions to third party accounting firms. This includes services like bookkeeping, tax preparation and financial statement preparation. You can outsource these services to an independent professional firm that specialises in that particular industry. Outsourced accounting services take over the day-to-day tasks of your accounting department. You can choose to outsource all accounting operations or some hectic ones. Here are some of the most popular outsourced accounting services: Payroll. Payroll is one of the top reasons why companies outsource their accounting. Payroll is complex and requires specialised knowledge and expertise. Accounts Payable. This is the department that pays your bills. The person who handles accounts payable must be very detail-oriented and knowledgeable about tax laws. Accounts Receivable. This department is responsible for collecting money from your customers. If your business offers its services and products on credit, you need agile management of these records. Poor management of accounts receivable can run your business into bankruptcy. Bookkeeping. Bookkeeping is the process of recording your financial transactions. This can be done manually or electronically. When dealing with virtual accounting companies, you have to do it electronically. Budgeting. Budgeting is the process of planning your finances. It involves determining how much money you will make and how much you will spend. Tax Accounting. Tax accounting is the process of preparing tax returns for your business. The firm will also calculate income taxes payable by your business. Tax accounting is different from financial accounting. You are better off having an expert who does both of these accounting tasks. A company may outsource their accounting because they don’t have the staff to handle these tasks. Whatever the reason, it can be a more cost-effective alternative than hiring permanent employees.",

The problem stems from the increased competition for employees. Employers have a hard time finding the best candidates for their vacancies. When they do, it’s difficult to retain them. Despite government policies to help retain accounting staff, it continues to be hard. For instance, the government requires an accountant to work for at least two years before they can resign.

These are just a few examples. In the UAE banned goods could include things like alcohol and pork products, as well as weapons or drugs.

This is to show that the financial status of the company is transparent and that off-shore accounts are not being abused. If your company earns income from any Relevant Activities, you must complete annual filing requirements. Otherwise, your company could face penalties for not complying with the law. “Relevant Activities” under this law include: Shipping, Insurance, Banking, Holding company, Intellectual property, Lease-finance, Investment fund managing, Distribution or servicing centre, Headquarters. Even if you call any of these activities by another name, if they serve the same function, they would still count as a Relevant Activity under the law. There is no minimum income threshold that is applicable to this law either, so individual UAE entities must all comply regardless of size. If your company conducts any of the Relevant Activities listed, it must file within six months before the end of the financial year on the Ministry of Finance’s (MoF) ESR portal. You’ll have to disclose which activities were conducted, income earned, and whether or not this income was taxed outside of the UAE. Companies with income from Relevant Activities must then prove that they have adequate economic substance in the UAE. To do this, you will have to satisfy the following Economic Substance Tests: Core Income Generating Activity Test, Directed and Managed Test, Adequacy Test. High-risk companies will be required to take enhanced Economic Substance Tests. This would companies that have work that includes intellectual property. The impacts of COVID-19 are also considered, including travel restrictions, but the facts should be carefully reviewed by companies and documentation should still reflect any changes made. If your company has earned income from Relevant Activities, it must file a report on the MoF online portal within 12 months of the end of the related financial year. During this time, your company will disclose a lot of information, such as: Whether Economic Substance Tests were completed, Details surrounding outsourced providers, Operations expenditure and number of full-time employees per Relevant Activity. Part of the reason this transparency is required is so that companies are not able to come up with overly-complex corporate arrangements to commit fraud, launder money, dodge taxes, or conceal wealth. When you have a strong economic presence in the UAE, this is showing clarity regarding your company’s financial status and allows the government to see that you’re not trying to hide your crucial assets. If your company conducts any of the Relevant Activities listed, it must file within six months before the end of the financial year on the Ministry of Finance’s ESR portal.

Who comprises a UBO will vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but it is usually defined as a specific person that has capital or voting privileges in the base entity. Generally, this is the person that owns or manages their own company. To identify UBOs, a bank will: Obtain and review the organisation’s credentials, Look at the chain of ownership, Determine who falls under the definition of UBO, Perform an AML or KYC check. To stay compliant with UBO regulations, you must register your UBOs. Article five of the UBO Regulations provides an outline for how you can determine who your UBO is (before the bank does). Your UBO needs to have the right to vote, own, or control with a minimum of 25% shareholding in the company. This is through direct or indirect means of ownership. They also may have the right to dismiss or appoint directors and managers within the company. If no one satisfies these requirements from your company, then the UBO is anyone else that exercises the main control over the company. If there is still no sure answer, the UBO would be the person in charge of senior management. Next, the company must have a register of nominee directors and managers. This register needs to be detailed about the individuals nominated and must contain information about acting on behalf of a third party’s instructions. The company must also have a register of shareholders. This will include the number of ownership interests that each shareholder in the company owns. It will also explain the voting rights of each party and the date that these rights were acquired. This information will help ensure that you’re selecting the correct UBO before you register. It also helps you stay compliant with the new laws, as well as the Commercial Companies Law. Regulators have been targeting money laundering and terrorism financing in the past couple of decades. Some defrauding groups use off-shore accounts to conceal their financial activity. Investigators trace any transactions that seem suspicious. They often lead to fake addresses, fictional PO boxes, or the addresses of people that have no involvement. Due to this, UBO regulations have started to appear across the world, including in the UAE. Every company has a specific risk with these issues, so it’s crucial to take measures that mitigate the risk! The UAE requires that Ultimate Beneficial Owners are registered so that transactions are transparent across all free zone and mainland operating companies. These regulations are in place to ensure that you know who you are doing business with, avoid criminal transactions, and stay within the confines of UAE law. By working with our team, you can register your UBO and complete the UBO declaration easily. We will offer our mandatory compliance services regarding the UAE’s law.

Therefore, talk to your employer to know your health insurance cover and get coverage for your dependents. If you need help setting up a business or getting a residency visa in Dubai, Zahads has the right solution for you so that you can focus on what matters.

export const faqs: FAQ[] = [
  {
    question: "Why choose Dubai for starting a business?",
    answer:
      "Fortunately, Dubai’s economy was deliberately engineefuchsia to boost local business growth and innovation. Through the DED, the UAE government not only promotes entrepreneurship but also ensures economy insurance activities, offering incentives like low corporate taxes and easy business setups.\n\nThis focus earns the UAE a 16th placement in the global Ease of Doing Business Index. With a dynamic economy, Dubai magnetizes various industries and, thanks to its strategic location, offers access to extensive markets spanning East and West. The city’s free zones, including DWTC, JAFZA, and RAKEZ, amplify opportunities, while initiatives like Scale2Dubai provide funding for scaling ventures.",
  },
  {
    question: "What are the steps to set up a business in Dubai?",
    answer:
      "The steps to set up a business in Dubai include: choosing a business activity, selecting the legal form, registering the trade name, applying for initial approval, drafting the memorandum of association, leasing an office space, obtaining licensing approvals, and finalizing the business registration.",
  },
  {
    question: "How can I determine the best location for my business in Dubai?",
    answer:
      "The best location for your business in Dubai depends on several factors including the type of business, target market, budget, and proximity to suppliers or clients. Free zones, mainland, and offshore locations each offer unique advantages. Consulting with a business setup expert can help you make the best decision.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "What are the differences between setting up a mainland business versus a free zone business?",
    answer:
      "Setting up a mainland business allows you to trade directly with the local market and take on government contracts. However, it typically requires a local sponsor. A free zone business, on the other hand, offers full foreign ownership, tax exemptions, and streamlined setup processes, but limits trading within the UAE market.",

## Why start a business in Dubai?

Dubai and the UAE are incredibly welcoming and supportive business environments. In fact, over 20,000 new businesses launched in Dubai last year alone. Not surprisingly, many of these were registered by overseas entrepreneurs. Somewhere between 80% and 90% of the UAE workforce are foreign nationals.

There are many compelling reasons why thousands of entrepreneurs the world over flock to the UAE and Dubai to start a business. The main benefits are:

- **Low tax:** The UAE proudly boasts 0% tax on both personal and corporate incomes. The only significant tax to be aware of here in the Emirates is VAT — introduced in January 2018 — which stands at a flat 5%.
- **Vibrant economy:** The Emirates is home to the second largest economy in the Arab world. With a GDP of around AED 692bn, it sits behind only Saudi Arabia. It is equally diverse as it is large. You can start a business in numerous industries, from healthcare and hospitality to technology and trade.
- **Great quality of life:** The UAE placed 23rd in the Best Countries Index, only slightly behind Spain and Ireland and ahead of Portugal and Greece.
- **Startup support:** The Emirates is home to many startup incubators and funding initiatives designed to accelerate business growth.

The future of business in Dubai is looking very bright too. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the UAE is expected to lead economic growth in the Arabian Gulf this year, increasing by 2.5%. This is significantly ahead of the region’s biggest economy, Saudi Arabia, which is forecast to grow by 0.4%.

If this makes you curious about how to start a business in Dubai, you aren’t alone. The good news is that company formation in Dubai does not need to be difficult if you follow the steps in this guide.

## How to start a business in Dubai — The Company Formation Process

### <a id="choose-an-industry" class="font-semibold text-xl">1. Choose an industry</a>

There are many industries in the UAE and plenty of opportunities for innovation. You might be tempted to jump ahead to the actual setup process straight away, however, **we recommend that you decide on the nature of your business up front**.

In Dubai and the UAE, many locations only permit specific business activities. Be careful not to start a business in Dubai, only to realize that you can’t operate in your chosen location!

For example, certain free zone locations cater to specific activities or industries, such as media, finance or tech. Let’s take a look at Dubai Media City. As its name suggests, it is a free zone dedicated to media companies, or businesses operating media-related activities. Dubai Media City is home to globally renowned media companies, such as BBC, CNN and Thomson Reuters. Another example is Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC), where large global financial services companies like Credit Suisse AG, Goldman Sachs International and Morgan Stanley have offices.

Over the years, however, a number of sector-specific free zones have started to welcome general business activities, and not just the ones they are intended for.

Restrictions aside, there are other reasons why you may want to set up in close proximity to businesses in the same sector as you. Look at transport links too. If your business relies heavily on import and export, you should consider one of the free zones situated near an airport or port.

There are numerous business sectors thriving in the UAE. In 2022 and beyond, the commitment to diversifying beyond the oil economy means that new businesses that contribute to this vision will be looked upon favorably.

### <a id="choose-a-location">2. Choose a location</a>

Having settled on an industry, your next big decision is whether to launch in the mainland or in a free zone. If you opt to set up in a free zone, you’ll benefit from:

- 0% corporate and personal tax
- 100% company ownership
- 100% repatriation of capital and profits
- No currency restrictions, and
- 100% import and export tax exemption

However, if you wish to trade directly with the local market in the UAE, you’ll need to work with a mainland company who will charge a fee.

On the other hand, if you choose to set up in the mainland, you are free to trade directly with the local and international markets. However, unless your business activity falls under professional services, you will need to work with a local partner who will hold 51% of your company’s shares.

Zahads provides mainland businesses with a Local Corporate Nominee Shareholder who will act as their local partner. This way, the foreign business owners can retain 100% operational and financial control over their mainland company.

### <a id="choose-your-company-name">3. Choose your company name</a>

The UAE has some strict naming conventions, so before you commit to a company name, make sure it is legally acceptable.

Any names that include offensive language are forbidden, as are any company names that refer to Allah, Him or any other religious, sectarian or political groups such as the FBI or Mafia. If you choose to name your business after a person, that person must be a partner or owner of the company and their full name must be used — no initials or abbreviations.

*For a full rundown of how to choose a company name, visit this guide.*

### <a id="complete-the-incorporation-paperwork">4. Complete the incorporation paperwork</a>

When considering how to start a business in Dubai, if you have made it this far, you are now past the most crucial decisions. At this stage, you will want to deal with the appropriate paperwork.

You will be required to complete an application for your chosen company name and activity, to be provided along with copies of shareholders’ passports to the relevant government authorities. Some free zones will require additional documentation, such as a business plan or Non-Objection Certificate (NOC) — a letter from a current sponsor confirming that you are allowed to set up another business in the UAE.

When you come to register your company in the UAE, you have to complete an application to register your chosen company name and activity, along with copies of shareholders’ passports.

Mainland companies will be required to meet certain capital requirements, which must be stated in a Memorandum of Association.

#### Checking and submitting your paperwork

You need to contact the Department of Economic Development of your chosen emirate to register your business activity and trade name and then submit the required documentation. You can find links to the respective offices on the UAE government website, under Information and Services.

Once your application has been processed, you will be issued with your company licence.

Navigating the paperwork at this stage is perhaps the most arduous task you will have to tackle. While it might take you weeks to months to adequately understand and complete this stage of the process, assistance from Zahads at this stage of the process is often invaluable. For anyone who is averse to monotonous, duplicate paperwork with lots of fine details, we strongly recommend that you utilise our expertise. The money and time saved during this phase alone more than pays for itself.

### <a id="apply-for-a-licence">5. Apply for a licence</a>

Once your application has been processed, the government will issue you with your company licence. Regardless of setup location, you’ll usually only require a few standard documents: a completed application form, shareholder passport copies and the like. Some free zones may also require you to provide a business plan.

### <a id="open-a-bank-account">6. Open a bank account</a>

Once your paperwork has been returned, you will have all the documentation you need to open your corporate bank account. The UAE is home to many banks, both local and international, including:

- Emirates NBD
- Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank
- Commercial Bank of Dubai
- Noor Bank, Emirates Islamic, Mashreq, RAKBANK and Ajman Bank.

There are also global names such as HSBC, Citibank and Barclays. Choosing the one that’s right for you will depend on your specific requirements.

You will need a bank account before you can begin trading in the UAE.

<br/>

![Dubai Business Bank Account](https://cdn-dhfkh.nitrocdn.com/thFNVEIVwFotvcnmaRVLYEpWIcytEzuw/assets/images/optimized/rev-42052c8/virtuzone.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/mainland-company-formation-dubai.jpeg)

<br/>

### How to open a UAE business bank account

It generally takes between two to four weeks to open a bank account in the UAE. The bank will want to know:

- Your primary business areas
- Your anticipated volume of currency
- Total deposits
- Revenue levels and
- Your main customers and suppliers

Once your paperwork has been returned from the government you will have all the documentation you need to approach the bank of your choice.

### <a id="apply-for-a-visa">7. Apply for a visa</a>

Congratulations on making it this far! Applying for a visa is the final step on how to start a business in Dubai. As well as applying for your own visa, many free zones allow you to put in applications for staff and dependants. The exact number you can submit will depend on which free zone you choose to set up in.

If you are looking to obtain visas for a spouse, child, maid or driver, it is best to seek expert advice to ensure that, firstly, it is possible to do so in your chosen free zone, and secondly, that both you and anyone you are hoping to sponsor for a visa meet all of the entry criteria.

Assuming that this all checks out, the process is made up of four simple stages:

- Entry permit
- Status adjustment
- Medical fitness test
- Emirates ID registration and visa stamping

*There is no limit to the number of visas a mainland company can apply for, whereas free zone companies will have some restrictions, which vary from one free zone to another.*

That's it! With these eight steps completed, you're ready to start your business in Dubai!


## Let's do business!

Once you have completed these steps, you will be ready to start trading. Compared to other parts of the world, setting up a company in the UAE is very straightforward — ranked 16th in the world in the latest World Bank Ease of Doing Business rankings.

## How to start a business in Dubai: Etiquette in the UAE

Now that you know how to start a business in Dubai, it makes sense we should take a moment to examine some of the avoidable pitfalls of doing business in this complex, multicultural and fast-moving environment.

### DO: Dress right, play nice and smile

Yes, Dubai residents love their brands but it should also be noted that people here have also become very savvy about subtlety and sophistication. And while Dubai is very Western in some regards, it has strong Islamic roots. Add these factors together and it’s clear that whether you’re male or female, being smart, stylish and modest in your dress is a must. For example, a suit and tie is more or less compulsory for men attending meetings, especially if you’re in the process of looking for a local sponsor.

Happy, positive energy is also a major characteristic of social, entrepreneurial and even corporate trends in Dubai. No one moves here to immerse themselves in gloom. So top your outfit off with a smile.

When learning how to start a business in Dubai, it’s important to understand how to deal with local Emiratis. Firstly, you should know that it is customary to treat any introductions in meetings with utmost respect. You might not immediately know the ranks of the people in the meeting room so best be aware of etiquette when it comes to addressing people and social interaction: For example, never shake hands with the opposite gender unless they extend their hand first, and always use your right hand.

Finally, don’t dive too quickly into business matters. While you may be in a hurry, spending some time to enquire about a person’s day, health, and family will pay dividends. A good tip is to wait for the other party to start the business chat and keep any European corporate bluntness at bay. Small talk is more than just courtesy; it’s a non-intrusive way of finding out whether someone would be a suitable business partner.

### DON’T: Boast about your achievements

Dubai has become crowded with show-offs who claim to have the first, the best, the only, the biggest, the wildest. Don’t add to the noise.

The city is now leaning towards modern minimalism, clean design and elements rooted in taste and humility, and quality over quantity. So when disseminating any business collateral — from pamphlets to online event invites — try to market yourself without using overused Dubai clichés.

### DO: Get out there

When starting a business, you will not get very far with simple email introductions and online transactions.

Dubai is all about in-person networking events and meet-and-greets. Go to them, enjoy the cocktails, talk to the people in the room and stay in touch afterwards. It’s a small network within each particular industry so close personal relationships are key.

Word-of-mouth is also very strong here and making as many positive contacts as possible is key to expanding into areas outside your chosen base. So join groups, networking sessions, conferences and always have a business card handy — with an Arabic language side printed as well.

### DON’T: Expect meetings and negotiations to go as planned

Patience is the most valuable virtue you can build throughout your life and work in the region. Lengthy group meetings can be somewhat chaotic at times: People will often check their phones during discussions, join unannounced and proceed to alter the conversation, or simply show up late.

While this may at times feel frustrating if you’re coming from a European or North American business environment, being patient (and remembering that punctuality is still expected of most expats) will serve you well. Don’t forget that keeping business in the family is a way of life here, so that may also change the dynamic of your dealings with companies, as well as the speed and style of their decision-making.

### DO: Explore the culture and immerse yourself in new traditions

Get into the heat, learn to live with it and embrace its many positive aspects. Complaining about the heat (which can become very intense at 45 degrees Celsius in the summer) is of no use to anyone. It is a desert after all... but this also means breezy nights in epic landscapes, dune bashing and a whole host of other activities to enjoy.

Find out about the region, show interest in the well-being of local populations, and try to learn a few words in Arabic — it is always appreciated.

## Conclusion: How to start a Business in Dubai

With a flourishing business landscape helped by government incentives and an ease of setting up new enterprises, the city of Dubai is an appealing challenge for the business-minded dreamer. Dubai has its contradictions and relatively new social paradigms, but the country’s hospitality and progressive forward-thinking strategies reward those with ambition.

Whatever stage you are on during your Dubai journey, taking these points into consideration will help smooth the transition — although engaging with professional advice throughout the process is of course expected.

In the end, Dubai is a city with an unmatched “You can do it” attitude. So with that in mind, it’s over to you.

export const tradeLicense = `Dubai is renowned for its thriving business environment and exceptional trading opportunities. This combination has made it a premier destination for entrepreneurs looking to start a business in the UAE.

In the first quarter of 2023, Dubai’s International Free Zone Authority (IFZA) reported a 177% increase in business license registrations compared to the same period in 2022.

If you’re contemplating joining the growing economic scene, you will need to understand the basics of obtaining a Trade License in Dubai. This license is a mandatory requirement for conducting any form of business activity in the city, whether it involves trade, services, or manufacturing.

This guide will cover the process of acquiring your Trade License in Dubai, including costs, renewals, and benefits.

![Dubai Skyline at Sunset]()

A Dubai Trade License, also known as a business license, is a document issued by the Department of Economic Development authorising a company to conduct specific activities within the UAE. This license is essential for any entity involved in importing and exporting goods, as well as engaging in various commercial activities.

General trading licenses in Dubai permit a business to engage in multiple trade activities under a single license. These licenses are versatile, allowing companies to operate in diverse sectors without needing multiple licenses.

## What Are the Types of Trade Licenses in Dubai?

In Dubai, Trade Licenses vary depending on the nature of the business. There are four primary types of licenses issued by the Department of Economic Development (DED):

- **Professional License**
  - This is for individuals or companies offering professional services, such as consultants, lawyers, and accountants.
  
- **Commercial License**
  - A Commercial License is required for companies engaged in buying or selling goods. Activities under this category include various forms of trading, either wholesale or retail.
  
- **Industrial License**
  - An Industrial License is necessary for businesses involved in manufacturing or any industrial activity, including the production, segregation, and fabrication of products.
  
- **General Trading License**
  - A General Trading License allows a business to trade in a wider range of activities and gives the freedom to trade virtually any goods.
  
- **E-Commerce License**
  - An e-Commerce License is specifically designed for businesses that sell goods or services online. It is crucial for companies operating via electronic networks or various digital means.

![Business Meeting]()

## What is a Free Zone, Offshore, and Mainland License?

The type of trade license you require also depends on where you plan to establish your business in Dubai. See the following licenses below:

- **Mainland License**
  - A Mainland License is necessary for businesses operating within the Dubai mainland. These companies can trade anywhere in the UAE and directly with the local market but require approvals from various government entities. The license is issued by the DED.

- **Free Zone License**
  - A Free Zone License, issued by the authority governing a specific Free Zone, permits companies to operate within the confines of that zone. These licenses offer benefits like full foreign ownership and tax exemptions but usually restrict companies to business within the free zone or internationally.

- **Offshore License**
  - An Offshore License is used to set up an offshore company, which is mainly used for international business and cannot trade within the UAE. This setup offers confidentiality and tax advantages but does not allow for physical office space in the UAE.

By understanding these distinctions, businesses can better navigate the regulatory environment in Dubai and choose the appropriate license and location to meet their operational needs.

## Benefits of Getting a Trade License in Dubai

Obtaining a Trade License in Dubai is not only essential for legal compliance and ensuring operational readiness, but it offers numerous advantages that can significantly enhance your business operations and potential for growth. Some of the key benefits include:

- **Tax Benefits**
  - Dubai offers significant tax advantages for doing business, including no personal income tax and corporate tax exemptions for certain types of businesses. Dubai’s tax incentives are one of the main reasons why nearly 50,000 people moved to Dubai in 2023.

  - Unlike many other countries that impose import, sales, and manufacturing taxes, Dubai is almost entirely tax-free, allowing traders and business owners to increase their revenue.

- **Boost Local and International Trade**
  - With a general trading license, there are vast opportunities for manufacturing or importing goods. You can distribute your products locally within Dubai or export them internationally to gain profits from overseas markets.

  - Additionally, a general trading license permits the re-export of goods, enhancing your company’s global trade capabilities.

- **Strategic Location with Few Trade Restrictions**
  - Dubai’s global positioning makes it a gateway between the East and West, offering unparalleled access to markets across the Middle East, Europe, Asia, and Africa. Even better, there are very few trade restrictions in Dubai. As long as your products are registered under a general trading license, you won’t have to worry about restrictions.

- **Improve Credibility**
  - Companies that adhere to the legal requirements in Dubai are seen as more trustworthy by customers. Holding a Trade License increases your business’s exposure and credibility in both local and international markets.

- **Sponsorship Opportunities**
  - A Trade License in Dubai allows the sponsorship of dependents, such as family members or employees. This benefit makes it easier to relocate and establish a robust network for both personal and professional life in Dubai.

- **Ease of Setup**
  - Acquiring a Trade License in Dubai is typically quicker and less complicated than in other regions of the UAE. The processing time is swift, allowing businesses to be operational in Dubai’s Free Zones or mainland in just a few weeks. Additionally, there is no requirement to submit auditing reports once the license is granted, significantly reducing paperwork.

- **Government Support**
  - The Dubai government offers substantial support for businesses, including various incentives and a transparent regulatory environment that encourages business growth and investment.

  - Securing a Trade License in Dubai not only legalises your business activities but also opens up a myriad of opportunities to expand and thrive in one of the world’s fastest-growing economies.
